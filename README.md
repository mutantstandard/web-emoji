# web-emoji

This is an Elm module that lets you seamlessly use Mutant Standard emoji in your web app.

Decode a Mutant Standard Data JSON, pair it with a set of Mutant Standard emoji and use it to:
- Create accessible emoji views with image descriptions.
- Create emoji pickers with proper categories and Mutant Standard modifiers.

Different versions of this package may change to fit changing standards in subsequent versions of Mutant Standard. Because Elm version numbering is strictly semantic, they cannot be the same - please check release notes so you can pair versions properly.
